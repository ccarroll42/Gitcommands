## Git commands

**Git commands apply to whatever directory you are in - your working directory. Be careful you are in the correct directory to do what you want!**

- git init (gets git to track a directory)
- git add (makes a file ready to be committed)
- git commit -m "Info you want entered in the log for the commit" (commits a file you just got ready with git add)
- git status
- git log
- git push (if a repository/directory is already initialized and connected to git, git push will update the Github repository to contain the last commited versions of the files in the respository/directory)
